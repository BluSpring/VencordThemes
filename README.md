# BluSpring's Vencord Themes / CSS Tweaks
Hi, for those who couldn't already tell or didn't already know me before, I am 'tism itself, I do not like change very much. Discord tends to do that a lot.

I decided to compile all of my Vencord themes over here to help me transfer stuff between computers, and also for anyone who is anything like me, so they don't have to spend the amount of time I did trying to figure out CSS selectors and rules.

All the CSS files consist of descriptions on what they are about, but if you just want a compilation of all of my tweaks, you can just use this link:
